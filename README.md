#Watch for Change in Hosts
A simple script which checks to see if there is a change in http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts

This will need edited to include the hosts you need for your system, if any, and the hostname for your system.

Run it once to see a diff of your hosts file and the one at the URL.

Run it again with --apply to apply it.
